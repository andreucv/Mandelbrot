# Mandelbrot
Mandelbrot fractal creation with a Raspberry Pi B+ Cluster

Saving in a file the RPiB+ network (with IPs) and exchanging its ssh private keys, you could run these Python scripts.
Serial is for one single RPi and Parallel for the RPi Cluster.

The result is the img in the repo.

Using the mpi4py library: http://mpi4py.scipy.org/
